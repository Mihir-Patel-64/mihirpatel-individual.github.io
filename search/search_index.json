The main controller is the PIC18F57Q43 Curiosity Nano, which reads signals from different sensors and controls the motor through an H-bridge circuit. This setup allows the system to decide when to open or close the curtain based on environmental conditions or user input.</p> <p>Power for the circuit comes from a 9 V source that passes through an LM7805 voltage regulator to produce a stable 5 V supply. The 5 V line powers the microcontroller, sensors, and logic circuits, while the 9 V rail powers the motor and H-bridge. Decoupling capacitors are placed near the regulator, MCU, and H-bridge to reduce noise and prevent voltage drops when the motor switches direction or speed.</p> <p>The motion sensor is connected to the RA1 pin on the microcontroller and outputs a digital signal whenever movement is detected. This allows the controller to trigger the curtain motor when someone enters or leaves the room. There is also a push button connected to a digital input that gives manual control of the curtain. A small red LED is included for debugging and system feedback, showing when the motor or sensors are active.</p> <p>The FAN8011N H-bridge driver controls the DC motor that moves the curtain along the rod. It takes two control signals from the microcontroller: a PWM signal to set motor speed and a direction control signal to switch between opening and closing. This setup provides full control of the curtain movement in both directions and allows smooth transitions.</p> <p>Two 8-pin connectors are used to interface with my teammates\u2019 boards. Connector 1 is linked to Zane\u2019s board and carries analog input data from his DAC output into one of my ADC pins. Connector 2 connects to Adrian\u2019s board and carries analog signals from his photoresistor and potentiometer, along with a few digital connections. These inter-board connections make it possible for my system to respond to environmental changes detected by the other boards, like light or temperature.</p> <p>Test points are added on important lines such as the 5 V power, ground, sensor outputs, and motor control pins. These points help during testing and troubleshooting since they let me measure voltage and signals directly without disconnecting any components.</p> <p>Overall, this schematic combines sensing, control, and actuation into one functional design. It meets the project goals by allowing both automatic and manual curtain control while staying compatible with the team\u2019s larger system.</p>"},{"location":"05-Power-Budget/Power-Budget/","title":"Power Budget","text":""},{"location":"05-Power-Budget/Power-Budget/#power-budget","title":"Power Budget","text":"<p>This page presents the Power Budget for the system design, ensuring that all voltage rails, regulators, and power sources can reliably meet the required current demand for every subsystem.</p>"},{"location":"05-Power-Budget/Power-Budget/#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<p>The Power Budget includes: - Power requirements of all major components. - Assigned voltage rails and current consumption. - Regulator and source selections with safety margins.  </p>"},{"location":"05-Power-Budget/Power-Budget/#power-budget-table","title":"Power Budget Table","text":""},{"location":"05-Power-Budget/Power-Budget/#downloadable-files","title":"Downloadable Files","text":"<ul> <li> <p>Power Budget EXCEL: Download Power Budget (Excel) </p> </li> <li> <p>Power Budget ZIP: Download Power Budget (ZIP)</p> </li> <li> <p>Power Budget PDF: Download Power Budget (PDF)</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"05-Power-Budget/Power-Budget/#power-rails-and-regulators","title":"Power Rails and Regulators","text":"Power Rail Regulator / Source Part Number Output Voltage Max Current (mA) Notes +12V External Power Supply Mean Well LRS-100-12 +12V 8500 Powers DC motor and PIR motion sensor +5V Buck Regulator Pololu S13V15F5 +5V 1500 Powers microcontroller, motor driver, LED, and user input switch"},{"location":"05-Power-Budget/Power-Budget/#power-source-verification","title":"Power Source Verification","text":"Power Source Part Number Output Max Current (mA) Used (mA) Remaining (mA) Wall Supply Mean Well LRS-100-12 +12V, 10A 8500 6876.25 1623.75 <p>The 12V source supplies all regulators and rails with plenty of remaining current.</p> <p>No battery supply is needed for this subsystem.</p>"},{"location":"05-Power-Budget/Power-Budget/#power-budget-summary","title":"Power Budget Summary","text":"<p>The power budget quantified the electrical demands of the subsystem and guided component selection.

The +5V logic rail is lightly loaded (\u2248110 mA), so a compact, efficient buck regulator (Pololu S13V15F5) provides ample headroom.
