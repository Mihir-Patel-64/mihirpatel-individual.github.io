## Microcontroller Hardware Verification Code

This page documents the firmware used to bring up and verify the subsystem hardware for my microcontroller project. The code exercises key peripherals (GPIO, ADC, PWM, UART, and simple control logic) to confirm that the board is assembled correctly and that each block behaves as expected under real operating conditions.

The project was developed and built in MPLAB X. To create your own package, right‑click the project name in the MPLAB X “Projects” window and select **Package** to generate a zip archive.
