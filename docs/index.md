## Introduction

* Welcome to my individual datasheet for EGR 304 – Embedded Systems Design, Fall 2025. I’m Mihir Patel, currently a Junior majoring in Robotics at Arizona State University. This datasheet provides an overview of my individual work and contributions to **Team 206**’s semester-long design project.

The purpose of this datasheet is to document my role, responsibilities, and technical contributions, serving both as a personal archive and a point of reference for anyone reviewing the full team project. 

### Project Summary

* This needs to be updated to reflect <ins>your version</ins> of the team project, so when shared not via the team's report, the reader gets an idea of the direction of the project and how your work will contribute to the overall success.
* Add context that ties into the link to your [team report.](https://embedded-systems-design.github.io/EGR304TeamTemplate/)


### My Contribution

* This needs to be updated to reflect a team introduction
* Content should also help an unfamiliar reader navigate to areas of interest. Information like:
