## Introduction

* Welcome to my individual datasheet for EGR 304 – Embedded Systems Design, Fall 2025. I’m Mihir Patel, currently a Junior majoring in Robotics at Arizona State University. This datasheet provides an overview of my individual work and contributions to **Team 206**’s semester-long design project.

The purpose of this datasheet is to document my role, responsibilities, and technical contributions, serving both as a personal archive and a point of reference for anyone reviewing the full team project. 

### Project Summary

* As part of Team 206, I contributed to creating a smart curtain control subsystem that leverages motion, temperature and ambient light sensors, real-time microcontroller logic, and modular components for customization and scalability. The objective is to enhance energy efficiency and usability in modern smart homes through responsive automation. This platform integrates iterative development, benchmarking, and data-driven testing to promote reliable performance and user-focused outcomes.

If you are interested in an overview of our team’s full design process, detailed documentation, and collaborative engineering practices, please refer to the [team report.](https://asu-egr304-2025-f-206.github.io/EGR304-TechMinds/)
